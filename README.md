# FUTURE_ML_01_Sales_Forecasting
AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard — Future Interns ML Task 1

## Project Overview
Time-series sales forecasting project built using historical retail sales data to predict future sales trends. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, forecasting, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Sample – Superstore
- **Granularity:** Monthly sales
- **Target Variable:** Sales amount

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Prophet (time-series forecasting)
- Matplotlib
- Power BI (dashboard visualization)

## Approach
- Aggregated historical sales data at a monthly level
- Analyzed sales trends and variability
- Trained a Prophet forecasting model on historical data
- Generated a six-month sales forecast
- Evaluated model performance using MAE and RMSE
- Visualized historical and forecasted trends

## Visualizations
- Monthly sales trend
- Six-month sales forecast
- Dashboard created using Power BI
- Python visualizations used as the primary reference

## Key Takeaways
- Time-series models can effectively capture sales patterns
- Forecasting supports planning and decision-making
- Data aggregation level significantly impacts forecast quality

## Future Enhancements
- Category-level and region-level forecasting
- Comparison with ARIMA and LSTM models
- Interactive dashboard deployment using Streamlit
